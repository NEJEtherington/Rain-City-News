### Getting Started

You will need node.js (at least v11.0.0) and npm (at least version 6.4.1) and a text editor such as VS code.

Fork and clone this project locally, then use npm to install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

This should bring in react, react-scripts, react-dom, @reach/router, axios, fontawesome, react-google-font-loader, and moment; you should check your node_modules folder to ensure that all required dependencies have been added.

### Running The App Locally

In your terminal, type:
